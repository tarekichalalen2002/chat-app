# chat-app
This is a simple and minimalistic chat app that enables users to create rooms to chat with their friends, 
the cool about this app is that it's built on raw websocket protocole with javascript backend for real time
chatting, I know it's like re-inventing the wheel since there are a lot of API's out there that can handle
this task easily, but coding from scratch was realy fun and I leaerned a lot during the process.

# Give it a STAR !!
